Code for week 5

# MaxWalkSat

Read the [lecture](mws.md) on Max Walk Sat.

Code  MaxWalkSat  for the
[Osyczka2](pdf/moeaProblems.pdf) model.

Do not be clever. This is throw away code. As quick
and as dirty as you like.

Use the same energy calcs as for SA.

Try and make a report that looks like the output from SA.

Making sense of output:

1.  The first column indicates the current best solution.

2.  The second column indicates the energy of the random solution selected in this iteration.

3.  A '+' indicates a new maxima. A '+' in the line adds to line length.

4.  The class printed at the bottom is the best solution point.
