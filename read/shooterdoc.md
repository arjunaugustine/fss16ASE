2. DO decide to get out hide out or take out the shooter

3. Be mindful not fearful

4. pay attention to the things that seem suspicious

5. Do not wait for others to validate your gut feeling

6. DO not assume someone else is calling 911. Someone has to be the first

7. If you can't get out, hide

8. Hide in a room that can be blocked/locked

9. Turn off any noise producing items - radio, mobile phone

10. If there are 2 or more people, spread out - do not huddle

11. Help others escape. Provide first aid to those who need it

12. if you are in the centre of the class, spread out(or take him out)

13. Total commitment and complete resolve if you decide to take him out. Throwing things, taking him out as a group

14. When the law enforcement arrives, their first target is to take out the shooter. So do not do anything that provokes them. be compliant and quiet, do not scream or yell, do not point at them or the shooter. Raise your arms (first thing)

15. DO not go running to them. Do not pose a threat to them.

16. If you are in a hostage situation be calm. Give the authorities a chance to negotiate. Not the same as an active shooter situation.
