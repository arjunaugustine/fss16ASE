## Motivation
Smartphones are now ubiquitous even though they are new systems whose security infrastructure is largely underdeveloped.
The existing Android operating system needs to be augmented with a framework to meet the security requirements of android applications.
Applications statically identify the permissions that govern the rights to their data and interfaces at installation time.
This means that the application/developer has limited ability thereafter to govern to whom those rights are given or how they are later exercised.
Thus, a necessary utility needs to be developed for applications to assert and control the security decisions on the platform.
