# MobiGUITAR Automated Model-Based Testing of Mobile Apps

## Key Words

## Motivation:
People adopt mobile platforms largely because of the apps they offer. Hence, quality assurance techniques like Software Testing is very important. Even though there are different techniques for testing mobile apps they are mostly stateless and never handled security. This is a big limitation because mobile apps are extremely state sensitive and have enhanced security. So there is a need for novel techniques. 

MobiGUITAR - Model GUI Testing Framework models the states of the app's GUI. It also have a test adequacy criteria based on state machines. The model and the criteria are used to generate test-cases and automate the app testing.

## Informative Visualizations:
An abstract State-Machine for the app - Aard Dictionary, a dictionary and online Wikipedia reader is shown in the paper. It shows different states and transitions between them making it easy to identify the different transitions which led to termnation of the app.
