# MobiGUITAR Automated Model-Based Testing of Mobile Apps

## Key Words
###Event Flow Graph (EFG): 
A graph representation of a GUI in which vertices represent events and an edge from event e1 to event e2 signifies that e2 can be performed immediately after e1.

###[Finite State Machine:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine)
A finite-state machine (FSM) or finite-state automaton (FSA, plural: automata), or simply a state machine, is a mathematical model of computation used to design both computer programs and sequential logic circuits. It is conceived as an abstract machine that can be in one of a finite number of states.

###[Breadth First Traversal:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search)
Breadth-first search (BFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph, sometimes referred to as a 'search key') and explores the neighbor nodes first, before moving to the next level neighbors.

## Motivation:
People adopt mobile platforms largely because of the apps they offer. Hence, quality assurance techniques like Software Testing is very important. Even though there are different techniques for testing mobile apps they are mostly stateless and never handled security. This is a big limitation because mobile apps are extremely state sensitive and have enhanced security. So there is a need for novel techniques. 

MobiGUITAR - Model GUI Testing Framework models the states of the app's GUI. It also have a test adequacy criteria based on state machines. The model and the criteria are used to generate test-cases and automate the app testing.

## Informative Visualizations:
An abstract State-Machine for the app - Aard Dictionary, a dictionary and online Wikipedia reader is shown in the paper. It shows different states and transitions between them making it easy to identify the different transitions which led to termnation of the app.

## Baseline Results:
Four apps were selected for testing MobiGUITAR - Aard Dictionary, Tomdroid, Book Catalogue and WordPress. All these apps are open source and are maintained by an active community of developers. MobiGuitar detected 10 bugs in total out of which one is related to Activity and three concurrency. The activity bug was because of the incorrect management of the life cycle of the activity. Few bugs were because of bad inputs. There were 2 bugs because of incorrect code reuse. It also detected bugs depended on programming mechanisms that arenâ€™t traditional but are typical of Android apps.

## Related Work:
MobiGUITAR was compared with two tools for Android testing - Monkey and Dynodroid. MobiGUITAR produces several types of artifacts - crash reports, finite state machine models, GUI sequences and also executable JUnit test-cases. However, Monkey produces only an Android LogCat report and Dynodroid produces a LogCat report and a code coverage report. Also when it comes to configurability MobiGUITAR is superior bcause it even lets you choose a whitelist of input values to be assigned with input widgets. Both Monkey and Dynodroid could detect only 3 bugs when MobiGUITAR detected 10 bugs.

## Scope for improvement :
- The results of Monkey and Dynadroid lacks exhaustive research. The paper has admitted this and attributes it to lack of proper debugging support.
- The MobiGUITAR generated testcases do not add assertions in the tests which needs to be done manually.
