## Key Words

#### GUI Ripping :
GUI Ripping is a dynamic process in which the software's GUI is automatically traversed by opening all its windows and extracting all their widgets (GUI objects), properties, and values. The extracted information is then verified by the test designer and used to automatically generate test cases. [Ripping](http://www.cs.umd.edu/~atif/pubs/MemonWCRE2003-abstract.html)
#### Monkey :
A non commercial random stress and crash testing tool for Android GUI's. It generates pseudo-random streams of user events such as clicks, touches, or gestures, as well as a number of system-level events. You can use the Monkey to stress-test applications that you are developing, in a random yet repeatable manner. [Monkey ](https://developer.android.com/studio/test/monkey.html)

#### GUI Exploration Criterion : 
The GUI exploration decides whether GUI exploration using a particular input is to be continued or not. Certain metrics may help in making this decision - ensure the depth of resultant GUI tree is less than a specified maximum, or if the resultant state is equivalent to an already evaluated state.

#### Activity Component : 
An activity represents a single screen with a user interface. For example, an email app might have one activity that shows a list of new emails, another activity to compose an email, and another activity for reading emails. Although the activities work together to form a cohesive user experience in the email app, each one is independent of the others. As such, a different app can start any one of these activities (if the email app allows it). [Activity](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/fundamentals.html)
