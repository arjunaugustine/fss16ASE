#Sofwtare Product Line Optimization

##Introduction

What is SPLOT ? The primary goal of SPLOT is to put Software Product Lines research into practice through the delivery of state-of-the-art online tools targeting academics and practitioners in the field. With SPLOT one can edit, debug, analyze, configure, share and download feature models instantly.
The project looks at a couple of models with varying number of decisions and objectives and applies various genetic algorithms to find the optimal pareto frontier of solutions. It also compares the results of applying
